## Notification Bot
The user creates an account with email confirmation. It is possible to create notes and add a time to 
send a reminder to Telegram, if the user has a Telegram ID. Notes can be edited and deleted, and there is a search 
for notes: priority is the title and then the content of the note.

There are two user roles: admin and user. Admin sees all notes and can add and delete users. User can only see their 
own notes.
